The Memento Pattern

DESCRIPTION

ConstraintSolver displays some Graphics. It manages the position of Graphics and shows them 
on request from the client. The user can move the Graphic as he wants.
Before the user moves the graphics, he may want to backup them so that he can restore the 
situation if he made some wrong moves. He does this by request a memento from the ConstraintSolver and keeps it. When he wants to restore, he hands the memento to the ConstraintSolver and 
everything will be back.

BUILD & RUN

    g++ Client.cpp
    ./a.out

PROBLEMS

This sample code is possibly the most complex of all.
I don't quite understand how to achieve incremental memento.
