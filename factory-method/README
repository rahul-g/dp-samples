The Factory Method Pattern

DESCRIPTION

The Application class deals with creating a product and doing some operation on it.
But it depends on its subclass to determine which product it manipulates.
CNApp and USApp create their own product respectively.

BUILD & RUN

    g++ Client.cpp
    ./a.out

PROBLEMS

It's a specific version of Template Method pattern.
