The Singleton Pattern

DESCRIPTION

Application often stores some configuration and want it to be accessed from anywhere 
in the application. Singleton may be a good choice for this situation, if the config  
file is not the option.
Config implementes the setconfig and getconfig function using a map. The private 
constructor ensures there is only one instance of Config in the application.
Singleton.h and Singleton.cpp demonstrates the use of a singleton registry and the 
subclassing of singleton.

BUILD & RUN

    g++ Client.cpp Config.cpp Singleton.cpp
    ./a.out

PROBLEMS

Using environment variables to determine which singleton to instantiate is pretty cool!
