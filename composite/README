The Composite Pattern

DESCRIPTION

All UI elements are Widgets. Some of them are single widget, while others may 
contain other widgets. 
Button and TextBox are single widgets, and GroupBox is a composite widget which 
may contain other widgets.
All widgets support a draw() operation which the client can use to show them.

BUILD & RUN

    g++ Client.cpp
    ./a.out

PROBLEMS

The Composite pattern is not clean, since there are some dilemmas:
1. The basic interface: wide or narrow?
   The wider the interface is, the more transparency the client gets. However, 
   there may be problems in handling the extra operations for the leaf nodes 
   if we design an interface including the leaf and composite. For example, if 
   the user writes `aleaf.addChild(new SomeChild())`, then we can never be right 
   either we delete the newed object or not: if we don't delete, it will cause 
   memory leak; if we delete it, this may not be what the user want.
   In the sample, we define a narrow interface and sacrifice some transparency. 
   But it's acceptable that the client is aware of whether a widget is a group 
   widget.
