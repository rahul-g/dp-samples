The Builder Pattern

DESCRIPTION

There are two drinks: coffee and tea, and two additives: sugar and ice.
One may order a glass of coffee and have some addtives. We view the additives 
as decorators of the drink.

BUILD & RUN

    g++ Client.cpp
    ./a.out

PROBLEMS

What's the purpose of the abstract Decorator class?
Does it merely provide it for ensuring design consistency?
