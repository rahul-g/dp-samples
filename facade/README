The Facade Pattern

DESCRIPTION

The string processor involves upcasing the string, and then revert it. The Upcaser 
and Revertor handles upcasing and reverting respectively. The Facade provides the 
client a simple interface to process string.

BUILD & RUN

    g++ Client.cpp
    ./a.out

PROBLEMS

The pattern is really a chicken rib... But we provide it here for integrity.
