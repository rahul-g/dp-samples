The Builder Pattern

DESCRIPTION

We wish to create a passage in two formats: normal txt and html.
The passage contains a title and some paragraphs of text.
The Director is in charge of the build process, including setting the 
passage title, begining a new paragraph and appending text to it.
The TextBuilder is the interface of passage builder and the two 
concrete classes NormalTextBuilder and HtmlTextBuilder create the passage
in their own way.

BUILD & RUN

    g++ Client.cpp
    ./a.out
