The Visitor Pattern

DESCRIPTION

The Chassis is a composite of equipments. By adding equipments to other equipments 
we build a equipments tree. We want to collect information of the nodes in the 
tree. An alternative is to use the Composite Pattern and let the composite do 
the collecting. Here we use visitors to do the job. 
The PriceVisitor traverses the tree and calculates the total price of all the 
nodes, while the PowerVisitor sums up the power.
The visitor have interface to visit all the concrete equipments. And all the 
concrete equipments inherit the interface to accept a visitor from the Equipment 
parent.

BUILD & RUN

    g++ Client.cpp
    ./a.out

PROBLEMS

The double-dispatch is really cool.
The Visitor Pattern contains an object structure and some visitors. We can add 
new operations on the nodes in the object structure, but it's difficult to 
add new type of nodes.
