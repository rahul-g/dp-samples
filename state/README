The State Pattern

DESCRIPTION

A TCPConnection may have an open state or a close state. Based on its current state, 
the connection behaves differently. When the connection is open, the close() operation 
closes the connection, while close() does nothing when the connection is closed() 
already. The state-specific behavior also changes the current of the connection. 
For example, the open() operation of the TCPClosed state changes the connection's state 
to TCPOpen.

BUILD & RUN

    g++ Client.cpp
    ./a.out

PROBLEMS

1. When we have many states and complex transitions, we may use a table to map the 
inputs to the transition state.
2. This pattern reminds me of the Tool Palette in Photoshop. The current tool acting 
as the state.
3. The code is a little messy, due to the integration of .h and .cpp.
