The Command Pattern

DESCRIPTION

Suppose we are manipulating an Data object through a GUI, there are buttons on the menu bar that let 
user click and perform corresponding function on the Data object. How do we connect the click of 
an button with the operation performed on the Data object? We could provide a callback function like 
button_clicked() in which we can write code to manipulate the Data object. We can also represent 
the operation with a Command object, which knows how to manipulate the Data object. When user clicks 
the button, we UNIFORMLY invoke the execute() function of Command. Different commands could be 
created by subclassing. We can also maintain a list of history commands and support undo.
The AddCommand and SubCommand add or sub the value in Data object respectively. The Invoker maintains 
the command history.

BUILD & RUN

    g++ Client.cpp
    ./a.out

PROBLEMS

We don't pass any parameters to the command, this may be a limit when we want more precise operations 
performed on the target.
