The Prototype Pattern

DESCRIPTION

The Application class can create different objects based on the prototype it has.
The products implement a clone() operation to allow creating itself without 
referencing its constructor.
CNApp and USApp are parameterized with different prototype and can create different
objects.

BUILD & RUN

    g++ Client.cpp
    ./a.out

PROBLEMS

The biggest benefit prototype brings is that it uses clone() to create a new object, 
rather than through the constructor. This allows creating a new object without referencing 
its constructor, thus makes dynamic loading of class possible.
Note prototype is NOT about making objects from 0 to 1, it's about creating objects from 1 
to many. The '1' is always created by runtime.
