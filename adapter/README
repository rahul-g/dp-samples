The Adapter Pattern

DESCRIPTION

There are two toys: a CNToy and a USToy. The Client can only play toys made in CN (by 
clicking the button "ShuoHua"). A USToy must be adapted before the client can play it. 
So we made an adapter which wraps the USToy making it a CNToy from the point of our 
Client.

BUILD & RUN

    g++ Client.cpp
    ./a.out

PROBLEMS

if we write in the base class as follows:
    virtual void func() const {
        ...
    }
then we MUST NOT forget the "const" in the derived class:
    void func() const{
        ...
    }
otherwise the polyphorsim magic will not happen.
