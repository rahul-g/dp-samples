The Proxy Pattern

DESCRIPTION

A document may contain some heavy objects to show. If we load these objects when inserting 
them to the document, we will get a slow application. The solution is to insert a 
placeholder that act as a real ojbect and load the realy object when needed. 
The WordProcessor manages the elements(Glyphs) that are added to it, and show it when 
we call it. When we want to add an Image object to the document, instead of instantiating 
an Image object, which may be costly, we insert an ImageProxy which is lightweight to 
instantiate and let the proxy to instantiate an Image object when needed.

BUILD & RUN

    g++ Client.cpp 
    ./a.out

PROBLEMS

Why don't we let the Image class implement the function of loading image when needed?
I think the answer is that Image class itself should focus on the processing of image. 
It should not depend on how we will use it. This focus can improve reusability.

There are there proxies: the remote proxy, the virtual proxy, and the protection proxy.
