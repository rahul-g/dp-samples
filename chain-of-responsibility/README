The Chain of Responsibility Pattern

DESCRIPTION

In an GUI application, some UI controls may contain help information to remind the user 
of the corresponding function of the control. The same control may have different 
hints in different context. If no specific help information is available, the application 
should display a more general information. To get the help information, we follow a 
chain of controls until some help is available.
The HelpHandler defines the interface for providing help information, when there is 
no help information in the current control, it forwards the request to the successor 
and let it handle the show help request.

BUILD & RUN

    g++ Client.cpp
    ./a.out

PROBLEMS

The object on the chain may accept the request as long as it has some information, as 
in this sample. Or it can decide based on some condition of the request. In this case, 
we can have the object pass the request as an object on to the its successor. The objects 
determines whether or not to accept the request by inspecting the request object.
